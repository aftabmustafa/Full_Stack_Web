This folder contains the work of many combine lessons that I have learnt...

In the index.html file, I have used the standard boilerplate of html.

<!DOCTYPE html> => This indicated the browser that we are using html 5 (the latest version of html)

<html> => This tag tells the browser that whatever written inside this tag is in html

<head> => It holds the information about our webpage and tell the browser how it should handle the webpage.
=> Inside the <head> tag many different tags are used such as <title>, <meta>.
=> The <title> tag is used to give title to our webpage.
=> The <meta> tag is very important and useful in our html document as it effect the search results.
=> There are many attributes we can use inside meta tag.
=> Here I am using <meta charset="utf-8">, which means that it is telling my browser that all the text written inside
my html document is utf-8 encoded. The utf-8 is latest encoder and the reason why we should use this is, that it includes
all the international symbols or the symbols present in the Unicode character set.
=> Let's say we want to use a special symbol or an emoji in our webpage or in title tag, if we don't mention that meta data it may happen that our browser is unable to encode that special character or emoji and show a random symbol. But if we include meta data, this type of problem can be overcome.
